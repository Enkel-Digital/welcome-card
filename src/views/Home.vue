                hello Addy!!! just wanted to welcome you to Penang Island... JK
                but thank you for being so courageous to move from NYP to TP to
                be a support to us! seeing how you serve and lead the people in
                Penang heartens me to know that you'll do the same and will do
                your best for His people and God! I cannot assure you that it
                will be an easy road ahead, but know that we got your back and
                we are willing to go through it together with you! jiayou Addy!
